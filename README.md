An oscillator that uses a signal line crossing MACD line as an observation point.
The intersection of Awesome Oscillator is used as a confirmation signal to buy or sell.
The intersection of MACD and AO histograms (yellow dot) is calculated as a potential point for closing a trade.

**HOW TO READ**
Long: green dot / plus sign, Short: red dot / plus sign. Yellow dot - exit point.
Area filled with red/green color is MACD histogram.
Area with red/green lines is Awesome Oscillator histogram.
Blue thick line is MACD main line. Orange line - MACD signal line.
Blueish filled area is a Rapid reaction zone for aggressive strategy.
Purple dot is a risky exit point.

**HOW TO USE**
*Conservative strategy (lower risk) - recommended*

* Look at the intersection of the MACD lines marked with a green/red dot.
* Wait for the confirmation (green/red plus sign on the oscillator axis). This will be your entry point.
* The intersection of MACD and AO histograms (yellow dot) is your exit point.

*Aggressive strategy (higher risk)*

* Set up a rapid reaction area at the comfortable level of risk.
This value is responsible for how much less reliable the signal we get.
The higher the value, the greater the potential profit. As well as the potential loss and the number of false positives.
This value needs to be adjusted INDIVIDUALLY for each security and time frame.
* Set up a rapid area length (number of periods).
Rapid area size is calculated based on SMA of previous Awesome Oscillator values.
This parameter is the length (periods) of a given SMA. It affects how much the rapid area oscillations will be smoothed.
This value is recommended to be adjusted individually for each security and time frame.
* Look at the intersection of the MACD lines marked with a green/red dot.
* When the MACD lines cross the border of the rapid zone - open a trade.
This event will be marked with a plus sign. It is considered a signal only after the previous step has been confirmed.
The further the lines are from each other, the better.
* Closing the trade is up to you. You can close when the yellow dot forms, or based on common Awesome Oscillator
tactics.
Additionally, you have a purple dot for the expected closing of a higher risk trade.

*From personal experience:* the standard strategy is best used on slow conservative stocks. While the risk strategy is
more suitable for 'Teslas' and biotechs and needs to be adjusted individually.
